# [Irreversible Electron Attachment - A Key to DNA Damage by Solvated Electrons in Aqueous Solution](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/ob/c5ob01542a#!divAbstract)

- oligomers bombared with low energy electrons in vacuum $\rightarrow$ damage to TXT trimers (X=A, G, T or C)
- hydrated electrons ($e_{aq}^-$, major form of lectrons generated during radio therapy) are negligible factor in damage to native DNA
  - $^\cdot OH$ radical induce damgage
  - $e_{aq}^-$ forms when hypoxia
- brominated nucleobases have a potential to sensitize DNA
  - bromopyrimidines lead to more strand breaks than bromopurines

# [Resonant Formation of DNA Strand Breaks by Low-Energy (3 to 20 eV) Electrons](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/287/5458/1658.long)

- low-energy electrons (1~20eV) are able to induce genotoxic damage, such as single- and double-strand breaks, even electron enrgy well below the ionaization limit of DNA (7.5~)
- DNA damage by 3-20eV electrons is highly dependent on the initial kinetic energy of the incident electron, where thresholds near 3 to 5 eV and intense peaks near 10eV
- the mechanisms of DNA damage depend not only on the quantum of energy absorbed, but also on the nature of the particle that deposits the energy
  - electron with energies below 15eV initiate fragmentation of small molecules essentially by attachment of the incident electron
  - this leads to the formation of a resonace state (a transient molecular anion TMA)
  - TMA decays by electron autodetachment (d1) or by dissociation along one or several specific bonds (d2)
  - the branching ratio between d1 and d2 depends in part on the above intrinsic characteristics of the specific TMA; the final damage yields also depend on extrinsic effects
- result
  - DNA strand breaks (below 14eV) are initiated by resonant electron attachment to the various basic DNA components, followed by bond dissociations within th eTMA's lifetime, ususally femtoseconds
  - Some fragmentation products subsequenctly react locally with other DNA components, leading to a double damaged site with breaks on opposing strands (E required for two ionizations are above 20 eV, here are below 20eV)
