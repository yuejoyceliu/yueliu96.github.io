[Oligomeric Structure and Three-Dimensional Fold of the HIV gp41 Membrane-Proximal External Region and Transmembrane Domain in Phospholipid Bilayers](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b04010)

## HIV-1 glycoprotein, gp41

- mediate fusion of the virus lipid envelope with the target cell membrane during virus entry into cells
- MPER and TMD
  - membrane-proximal external region (MPER)
    - harbors the epitopes for four broadly neutralizing antibodies
    - $\alpha$-helix
    - binds to the membrane surface
  - transmembrane domain (TMD)
    - anchors the protein to the virus lipid envelope
    - most $\alpha$-helix, moderate $\beta$-sheet
    - spans the bilayer
  - full-length MPER-TMD: trimeric helix-turn-helix structure in lipid membranes
  - both are important for HIV entry into cells
    - Trp-to-Ala mutations in MPER and deletion of the MPER $\rightarrow$ abrogate virus entry and membrane fusion
    - replace gp41 TMD with other TMD $\rightarrow$ impact fusion activity
    - truncate C-terminus of TMD in simian HIV $\rightarrow$ reduce fusogenicity

  structure unchanged within 235K to 303K

## MPER-TMD Structure

- Turn Structure
  - helix-turn-helix
  - MPER as bound to the membrane surface while TMD spans the bilayer
  - monomeric
- Continuous Helix
  - continuous helix, perpendicular to the membrane plane
  - tilted orientation for long helix to reduce the hydrophobic mismatch between the peptide adn the bilayer portion of the bicelle
- trimeric-MPER + monomeric-TMD

These divergent structural conclusions may arise from the truncated nature of th epeptide sequences in most studies, but could also reflect an inherent conformational plasticity of this region of gp41, which may be importanct for the protein to fold into different structures at different stages of virus-cell fusion

## Question
- inconsistent and contradictory structural information abounds in the literature about the C-terminal membrane-interaction region of gp41
- difficulty of crystallizing and solubilizaing the MPER-TMD, most structural studies of this functionally important domain were carried out using either only MPER or only TMD
