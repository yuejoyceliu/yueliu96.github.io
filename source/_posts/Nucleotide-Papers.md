# [UV–Vis Action Spectroscopy Reveals a Conformational Collapse in Hydrogen-Rich Dinucleotide Cation Radicals](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b01856)

- Why
  - DNA cation radicals are intermediates during the interaction of DNA with high energy particles
  - electron defect initially located in a nucleobase, migrates along the DNA backbone to reside on guanine
  - DNA behavior at atomic-level needed
- Goal
  - proton and electron transfer along a single strand in DNA and related cation radicals
  - use deoxyriboadenosine dinucleotide (dAA) and riboadenosine chimeras (pseudo-dAA)
- Intro
  - dication$\rightarrow$catrad: conformation collapse
  - dAA
    - intra proton migrations btw nucleobases
  - pseudo-dAA-catrad
    - zwitterionic structures
    - Coulomb stablization
  
## 1. Gaseous Protonated A

- N-1, N-3, N- 7, N-9, and NH2 (N-10) positions: potential protonation sites
- dA: N-3
  - H bond stablization
- dAA: N-1, N-1''
- psedo-dAA: N-3, N-3''
  - H bond stablization

## 2. Form Cation Radicals

- ETD dAA+2$H^+$: $[M-H]^+(m/z\ 565)$, $[M-H-A]^{+\cdot}(m/z\ 431)$, $w^+(m/z\  332)$
- M+CE/DBCE$\rightarrow$ESI$\rightarrow$ETD: $M^{+\cdot}$
- CE favors N-1 position

## 3. UV-Vis Action Spectrum 

- vis: broad band at 465nm; uv: 340nm, 260nm 
- channel: $w^+(m/z\ 332)$, $[w+H]^{+\cdot}(m/z\ 333)$, $[M-H-A]^{+\cdot}(m/z\ 431)$
- 260nm is same with [pccp_adenine1](#ap1) and [pccp_adenine2](#ap2)

## 4. Dinucleotide Cation Radical Structures

- if exothermic, isomerization driven by proton migrations will occur sponstaneously and driven by exotherimic energy provided by the electron attachment reaction. 
- electron not attach N-1
- hydrogen migration might face substantial energy barrier. [[A+H1](#l1) | [A+H2](#l2)]
- proton transfer (move radical position)$\rightarrow$optimize$\rightarrow$ more stable structures
- theoritical uvvis spectra and molecular orbital analysis $\rightarrow$ possible tautomers & spectra contributions $\pi_z \rightarrow \pi_z^*$

## 5. Adenine Ribonucleotide Chimeras

- uv-vis analysis: similiar band position to dAA 
- aromatic diesters
  - opt: zwitterionic dication-anion radicals $\longleftrightarrow$ folded structure (exothermic conformation collapse)
  - Coulomb stablization of zwitterionic structures is analogous to the solvent effects governing DNA ionization ([DNAion1](#ion1) | [DNAion2](#ion2))
- cyclohexane diester: 
  - adenine cation and radical moieties are located on the opposite sides of the cyclohexane ring 
  - attractive ion−dipole and ion-induced dipole interactions

# [Hydrogen-Rich Cation Radicals of DNA Dinucleotides: Generation and Structure Elucidation by UV–Vis Action Spectroscopy](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b07925)

- Why
  - DNA ionization causes chemical changes leading to complex process of DNA damage; intermediates: DNA cation radicals
  - the intrinsic electronic properties of the reactive cation radical intermediates just are elucidated recently
  - without solvent and counterions, gas-phase studies can focus on the intrinsic electronic and chemical properties of the radical species ([ref](#ref))
- Goal
  - purine and pyrimidine nucleobases in dinucleotide cation radicals exhibit different properties: 
    - nucleobase stacking
    - hydrogen bonds
    - propensity for undergoing intramolecular proton transfer
- Intro
  - cation radical
    - $(dGG+2H)^{+\cdot}$: conform collapse, 3'-G C-8-H radical
    - $(dCG+2H)^{+\cdot}$: collapse, a mixture of 5'-C and 3'-G radicals
    - $(dGC+2H)^{+\cdot}$: retain structure, a 3'-C radical
  -  basicity ($pK_a$) in water $\Leftrightarrow$ ability of proton-transfer reactions in solution
     -  $(G+H)^\cdot$: 20.0
     -  $(C+H)^\cdot$: 4.6
  
## 1. Dinucleotide Cation Radical Generationf

- larger oligos form stable cation radicals
- smaller one needs DBCE

## 2. Dinucleotide Cation Radical Collision-Induced Dis- sociation and Photodissociation Spectra

- CID of cation radicals
  - $(dGG+2H)^{+\cdot}$: $[M-G]^{+\cdot}$, $[M-G-H]^{+}$, $[d_1/w_1]^+$, $[d_1/w_1+H]^{+\cdot}$
  - $(dGC+2H)^{+\cdot}$: $[M-H_2O]^{+\cdot}$, $[M-C]^{+\cdot}$, $[M-G-H]^{+}$, $d^+$, $[w+2H]^+$, $[z_1+H]^{+\cdot}$
  - $(dCG+2H)^{+\cdot}$: $[M-H_2O]^{+\cdot}$, $[M-C-H]^{+}$, $[M-C]^{+\cdot}$, $w_1^+$
- how nucleobase nature and position affect
  - C at 3'-end $\rightarrow$ elimination of water
  - C at 5'-end $\rightarrow$ lost as $[C+H]^\cdot$
  - loss of C > loss of G
  - 5'-C suppresses 3'-G loss
- UVPD similiar to CID
- close shell systems have similiar absorption $\rightarrow$ not only associated with radical moieties
  
## 3. $[dGG+2H]^{+\cdot}$ Action Spectroscopy and Ion Structures

- action spectra: 450-470nm, 330, 310 and 270nm
- structure:
  - H positon
    - most basic: N-7
    - 2nd basic: 6-OH−N-3−H
  - CE at 5'-terminal stable than that at 3'
  - H transfer
    - exthothermic 
    - cation and radical at 5'-G most stable
    - cation at 3'-G, radical at 5'-G relatively stable and match spectra
- 450-460nm: SOMO, 156$\alpha (\pi)\rightarrow$ combined $\pi^*$ at 3'-G radical
- $(G+H)^\cdot$ estimates thermal shift and broadening
- 215kJ/mol ($\lambda$<550nm) enough to drive dissociation

## 4. $[dCG+2H]^{+\cdot}$ Action Spectroscopy and Ion Structures

- action spectra: weak 450-480nm, strong 350 and 280nm
- structure:
  - cytosine: O-2 and N-3 basic positions
  - CE at 5'-C ring and 3'-G ring
  - H posiitons: dC3G7
  - H transfer
    - transition state high, but exthothermic finally (kinetic hampered)
    - major: radical at C; minor at G
    - RRKM calculation: 310kJ/mol internal energy needed for conversion
    - $E_{int}=E_{thermal}+E_{exc}$, where $E_{exc}$ is part (calculated by heat capacity) of exthothermic reaction energy 
- dissociation of C or (C+H)$^\cdot$ are less endothermic than G or (G+H)$^\cdot$

## 5. $[dGC+2H]^{+\cdot}$ Action Spectroscopy and Ion Structures

- action spectra: extremely weak broad 620nm, 420-500nm and 360nm, strong 285nm
- structure
  - CE at 3'-C ring
  - radical at C
  - proton transfer exthothermic but not fit spectra 
  
## 6. Discussion

- site of electron attachment to the dications depends on
  - nucleobase nature
     C>G: *RE*$_{adiab}$*(C)*=5.17eV; *RE*$_{adiab}$*(G)*=4.46eV
  - nucleobase position
    dGG: 5'-G>3'-G
- ring stacking and proton transfer
  - dGG: nucleobase stacking, faciles proton transfer
  - dGC and dCG: nucleobases perpenticular, kinetically hampered
- $(G+H)^{+} (aq,pK_a=3.3)+(G+H)^\cdot (aq) \overset{\Delta G=-95 kJ/mol}{\longrightarrow} G(aq)+(G+2H)^{+\cdot}(aq,pK_a\approx20.0)$
- $(C+H)^{+} (aq,pK_a=4.6)+(C+H)^\cdot(aq) \overset{\Delta G=-0.1 kJ/mol}{\rightleftharpoons} C(aq)+(C+2H)^{+\cdot}(aq,pK_a\approx4.6)$

# [Watson-Crick Base Pair Radical Cation as a Model for Oxidative Damage in DNA](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b01251)

## Background
- mechanisms of DNA damage poorly understood
  - oxidation $\rightarrow$ deprotonation at G $\rightarrow$ H abstraction from sugar $\rightarrow$ DNA strand breaks $\rightarrow$ mutagenesis and cancer
  - probing initially formed radical cation challengeing
- proton-coupled electron and hole transfer is an important
feature in radiation damage process

## Notes
- gas-phase acidity data may be more appropriate to characterize the equilibrium position of the proton in oxidized GC base pairs ([ref](#gasbetter))
- Guanine
  1. the lowest ionization energy among GATC, both in solution and gas $\Rightarrow$
  2. electtron loss during ionization of DNA mostly occurs form G $\rightarrow$
  3. G radical cations enhaces acidities than G $\Rightarrow$ 
  - dG$^{+\cdot}$-dC pair: H transfer from G to C (G3$\rightarrow$C3) $\Rightarrow$ relocation of radical site to sugar
- homolytic bond dissociation enthaloy of 401kJ/mol for [dG+H(N$_7$)]$^+$ is comparable to that for a typical C-H bond $\Rightarrow$ other radicals via intra- or intermolecular H-abstraction reactions
- CID
  1. $[dGdC]^{+\cdot}-CH_2O$: occurs on the sugar of G
  2. further loss $C_2H_3O_2$
  3. $[dGdC]^{+\cdot}-C_5H_8O_3$ not nucleobase specific 

# [Gas-Phase Fragmentation of Oligonucleotide Ions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387380604003264?via%3Dihub)

- The preferred dissociation channels for a given ion are a function of the ion type, the structure o fth emolecule, the internal energy distribution of the ion and the time-frame over which the fragmentation reactions can evolve
- McLuckey's nomenclature for backbone cleavages (a/w,b/x,c/y,d/z, 5'-frag:a,b,c,d; 3'-frag: w,x,y,z)
