# [UV–Vis Action Spectroscopy Reveals a Conformational Collapse in Hydrogen-Rich Dinucleotide Cation Radicals](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b01856)

- Why
  - DNA cation radicals are intermediates during the interaction of DNA with high energy particles
  - electron defect initially located in a nucleobase, migrates along the DNA backbone to reside on guanine
  - DNA behavior at atomic-level needed
- Goal
  - proton and electron transfer along a single strand in DNA and related cation radicals
  - use deoxyriboadenosine dinucleotide (dAA) and riboadenosine chimeras (pseudo-dAA)
- Intro
  - dication$\rightarrow$catrad: conformation collapse
  - dAA
    - intra proton migrations btw nucleobases
  - pseudo-dAA-catrad
    - zwitterionic structures
    - Coulomb stablization
1. Gaseous Protonated A
  - N-1, N-3, N- 7, N-9, and NH2 (N-10) positions: potential protonation sites
  - dA: N-3
    - H bond stablization
  - dAA: N-1, N-1''
  - psedo-dAA: N-3, N-3''
    - H bond stablization
2. Form Cation Radicals
  - ETD dAA+2$H^+$: $[M-H]^{+\cdot}(m/z\ 565)$, $[M-H-A]^+(m/z\ 431)$, $w^{+\cdot}(m/z\  332)$
  - M+CE/DBCE$\rightarrow$ESI$\rightarrow$ETD: $M^{+\cdot}$
  - CE favors N-1 position
3. UV-Vis Action Spectrum 
  - vis: broad band at 465nm; uv: 340nm, 260nm 
  - channel: $w^{+\cdot}(m/z\ 332)$, $[w+H]^+(m/z\ 333)$, $[M-H-A]^+(m/z\ 431)$
  - 260nm is same with [pccp_adenine1](#ap1) and [pccp_adenine2](#ap2)
4. Dinucleotide Cation Radical Structures
  - if exothermic, isomerization driven by proton migrations will occur sponstaneously and driven by exotherimic energy provided by the electron attachment reaction. 
  - electron not attach N-1
  - hydrogen migration might face substantial energy barrier. [[A+H1](#l1) | [A+H2](#l2)]
  - proton transfer (move radical position)$\rightarrow$optimize$\rightarrow$ more stable structures
  - theoritical uvvis spectra and molecular orbital analysis $\rightarrow$ possible tautomers & spectra contributions $\pi_z \rightarrow \pi_z^*$
5. Adenine Ribonucleotide Chimeras
  - uv-vis analysis: similiar band position to dAA 
  -  aromatic diesters
     - opt: zwitterionic dication-anion radicals $\longleftrightarrow$ folded structure (exothermic conformation collapse)
     - Coulomb stablization of zwitterionic structures is analogous to the solvent effects governing DNA ionization ([DNAion1](#ion1) | [DNAion2](#ion2))
  - cyclohexane diester: 
    - adenine cation and radical moieties are located on the opposite sides of the cyclohexane ring 
    - attractive ion−dipole and ion-induced dipole interactions



# [Hydrogen-Rich Cation Radicals of DNA Dinucleotides: Generation and Structure Elucidation by UV–Vis Action Spectroscopy](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b07925)

- Why
  - DNA ionization causes chemical chnages leading to complex process of DNA damage; intermediates: DNA cation radicals
  - the intrinsic electronic properties of the reactive cation radical intermediates just are elucidated recently
- Goal
- Intro
