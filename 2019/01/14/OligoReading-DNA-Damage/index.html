<p>The types of information that would be useful in this regard are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Structures of radiation-induced lesions</li>
<li>Yields of the various lesions</li>
<li>Identities of lesions that might be expected to be biologically significant</li>
<li>Chemical mechanisms by which these lesions are produced</li>

</ol>
<p>The damage to DNA in mammalian cells in generally considered to arise from two sources, the direct effect and the indirect effect. <strong>Direct-effect damage</strong> originates from energy deposited in the DNA molecules; <strong>indirect-effect damage</strong> arises following attack on the DNA of reactive species produced by ionizations in other molecules. The major source of the indirect effect is the free radicals produced from water. The reaction of a cation water radical with DNA could produce a cation DNA radical and it is possible that this could result in a different radiation product.</p>
<p>The initial damage produced by either direct ionization or by free-radical attack is randomly distributed among the DNA bases and the deoxyribose moieties. The ion radicals produced by direct ionization of DNA moieties may react further to produce radicals equivalent to those formed by OH-radical attack on the DNA. A cation radical formed in a saturated moiety of DNA could deprotonate, forming the same radical that would have been formed by H-atom abstraction by an OH radical. Similarly, a cation radical formed the same species as would be produced by addition of an OH radical to the same site. <strong>Consequently, the same produces might be expected from both direct ionization and from OH-radical reaction.</strong> The products from the base radical cations are qualitatively similar to those formed as a consequence of OH radical attack.</p>

One-Electron Reduction Potentials of Adenosine and Guanosine Radicals in Aqueous Solution"></a><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ja962255b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Easily Oxidizable Is DNA? One-Electron Reduction Potentials of Adenosine and Guanosine Radicals in Aqueous Solution</a></h1><p>The direct and indirect effects of ionizaing radiation on DNA, particularly those relating to base alterations and sigle-strand breaks, are mediated  by (the one-electron deficient) DNA base radicals.</p>
<p>The ionization of DNA, induced either by ionzing radiation, 193 nm photolysis, or chemmi-ionization by strong transient oxidant such as $SO_4^{\cdot -}$ or Tl(II) results in the formation of <strong>a positive “hole”</strong>. ESR experiments show that this positive “hole” is transmitted to a <strong>guanine</strong> moiety. The driving force for such intramolecular electron “hops” is the difference in the reduction potentials of the DNA base radicals. The guanine radical apparently has the lowest reduction potential.</p>
<p>The reduction potentials of the neutral purine radicals in neutral solution ($E_{pH}$), $E_7(Guo^\cdot /Guo)=1.29V$, $E_7(Ado^\cdot /Ado)=1.42V$, $E_7(deocytidine)\approxeq 1.6V$ and $E_7(thymidine)\approxeq 1.7V$. These numbers explain the observed positive hole transfer from an oxidized base to the guanine moiety.</p>
<p>The reduction potential of guanosine radical is higher than that of alkyl peroxyl radicals ($E_7=1.05V$), which means that (the electrophilic) lipid peroxyl radicals cannot oxidize DNA bases by one-electron transfer. On the other hand, the reduction potential of guanosine radical is considerably higher than those of aromatic and sulfur amino acids (e.g., $E_7(tryptophan)=1.01V$ and $E^0(RS^\cdot /RS^-)=0.75V$), which means that the repair of a positive hole (electron deficiency) in DNA by a histone protein is thermodynamically feasible.</p>
<h1 id="Purine-bases-nucleosides-and-nucleotides-aqueous-solution-redox-chemistry-and-transformation-reactions-of-their-radical-cations-and-e-and-OH-adducts"><a href="#Purine-bases-nucleosides-and-nucleotides-aqueous-solution-redox-chemistry-and-transformation-reactions-of-their-radical-cations-and-e-and-OH-adducts" class="headerlink" title="Purine bases, nucleosides, and nucleotides: aqueous solution redox chemistry and transformation reactions of their radical cations and e- and OH adducts"></a><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cr00093a003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purine bases, nucleosides, and nucleotides: aqueous solution redox chemistry and transformation reactions of their radical cations and e- and OH adducts</a></h1><p>The purine and pyrimidine bases are the most sensitive to radiation-induced modification or destruction of the the componets of DNA, itself the most critical of the cellular targets. </p>
<p>The <strong>pyrimidines and the purines</strong> have a very high reactivity with respect to both $e_{aq}^{\cdot -}$, $H^\cdot$ and $^\cdot OH$, wheras the <strong>ribose phosphate moiety</strong> is less reactive with $^\cdot OH$ and almost unreactive with respect to $e_{aq}^{\cdot -}$. An $e_{aq}^{\cdot -}$ produced near a DNA chain will therefore end up with a pyrimidine or purine base, whereas an OH radical is as well likely to be scavenged by a deoxyribose unit, a reaction that has a good chance of leading to a DNA chain break. </p>
<p>The purines have a very high intrinsic reactivity with $e_{aq}^{\cdot -}$. On <strong>introduction of one phosphate group</strong> into the system the rate constants <strong>decrease</strong>. Since phosphate groups are not expected to reduce the electron affinity of the base moieties, this rate-decreasing effect must be due to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged reactances and nucleotide. Repulsion is, of course, multiplied in the case of the polynucleotides, such as poly(A) or DNA.</p>
<p>In the case of adenosine, (1) Moorthy and Hayon: the radical existing in the pH range 5-9 (characterized by $\lambda_{max}=320nm$ and $\epsilon(320nm)=4.9\times 10^3M^{-1}cm^{-1}$) is a doubly protonated electron adduct (a radical cation); (2) Hissung et al. monoprotonated (a neutral radical) at pH 4-9 and up tp pH=11.5. The electron adduct of adenosine ($A^{\cdot -}$) is protonated by $H_2O$ in &lt;5 ns, which forms the product ($ANH^\cdot$)</p>
<p>Nitrogen has a greater electron affinity than carbon, it is reasonable to assume that the negative charge in the radical anion resides mainly on the nitrogens.</p>
<p>Electron transfer from base to base along the helix axis is much faster than proton transfer, which occurs in the direction perpendicular to the helix axis. Hower=ver, proton transfer along the interbase hydrogen bonds involves only a slight displacement of the equilibrium position of the bridging proton and is therefore likely to alos be an extremely fast process (estimated reaction period $\leq 1ps$) against which electron transfer has to compete. Rates of electron transfer in DNA have been estimated by quantum chemical methods to be of the order $10^{14}s^{-1}$.</p>
<p>Proton transfer leads to separation of charge from spin and it thus converts radical cations (positive holes) or radical anions (localized but mobile electrons) into neutral radicals. This means that proton transfer destroys or at least slows down the mobility of the charge and spin carriers, which  are thereby “frozen” or trapped. </p>

<p>Radical ion pairs with lifetimes of tens to hundreds of picoseconds are formed in single-stranded DNA by photoinduced electron transfer (ET) between stacked nucleobases. Picoseconds lifetimes have also been observed in double-stranded DNA.</p>
<p>Intrastrand electron transfer can potentially trigger interstrand proton transfer. This paper is the first observation of photoinduced proton transfer (PT) in DNA.</p>
<p>Radical ions of single nucleobases are considerably stronger acids and bases than their parent molecules. Single PT can occur in one or both of the base pair radical ions generated by intrastrand ET, transforming an initial radical ion into a neutral radical and causing the complementary base to acquire a charge through deprotonation or protonation. ET/PT thus separate spin from charge in a base pair, yielding distonic radical ions. PT could take place on an ultrafast time scale in most base pair radical anions, but is less likesly in base pair radical cations.</p>

<p>Nucleobase radicals are the major intermediates generated by the direct (e.g., $dA^{\cdot +}$) and indirect (e.g., $dA^{\cdot}$) effects of $\gamma$-radiolysis.</p>
<p>The deprotonation of $dA^{\cdot +}$ is a key intermediat involve in DNA electron transfer, a process by which radical cations (holes) migrate through DNA. The deprotonation of $dA^{\cdot +}$ generates $dA^\cdot$, which attenuates hole transfer. $dA^\cdot$ oxidizeds dG, likely via a proton coupled electron transfer in which the first step is endothermic (-0.16V) but the overall reaction is thermodynamically favorable (0.13V) and has been observed in similar systems in DNA</p>
<h1 id="Mechanism-for-Radical-Cation-Transport-in-Duplex-DNA-Oligonucleotides"><a href="#Mechanism-for-Radical-Cation-Transport-in-Duplex-DNA-Oligonucleotides" class="headerlink" title="Mechanism for Radical Cation Transport in Duplex DNA Oligonucleotides"></a><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja0378254" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mechanism for Radical Cation Transport in Duplex DNA Oligonucleotides</a></h1><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yueliu96/blog_images/master/dna%20Gradical.jpeg" alt="G radical"></p>
<p>DNA oligomers have a covalently linked anthraquinone group (AQ) and containing $[A_nGG]_m$ or $[T_nGG]_m$ segments. Irradiation with UV light that is absorbed by the AQ causes injection of a radical cation into the DNA. The radical cation migrates through the DNA, causing chemical reaction, primarily at GG steps, that leads to strand cleavage after piperidine treatment. Radical cation hopping (form one site to adjacent sites) in these duplex DNA oligomers is a process that occurs on a microsecond time scale. The hopping rate depends on the number and kind of bases that separate the GG steps. It is fastest when the separating bases on the GG-containing strand are A and somewhat slower when they are T but reaches a limit when there are four or more bases separating the GG steps.</p>
<h1 id="Oxidation-of-DNA-Damage-to-Nucleobases"><a href="#Oxidation-of-DNA-Damage-to-Nucleobases" class="headerlink" title="Oxidation of DNA: Damage to Nucleobases"></a><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar900175a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxidation of DNA: Damage to Nucleobases</a></h1><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yueliu96/blog_images/master/dna%20duplex%20break.jpeg" alt="duplex break"></p>
<p>The losss of an electron (ionization) from DNA generates an electron “hole” located most often on its nucleobsaes, that migrates reversibly through duplex dNA by hopping until it is trapped in an irreversible chemical reaction that damages nucleobases. In normal DNA, comprising the four common DNA nucleobases G, C, A and T, reaction occurs most commonly  at a guanine. Both electronic and steric effects control the outcome of this process. It the DNA oligomer does not contain a suitable guanine, then reaction of the radical cation occurs at the thymine of a TT step, primarily by a tandem process.</p>
